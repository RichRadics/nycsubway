# New York Subway Usage - Movement through Time

As part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, I performed some cleanup and analysis of some data from the New York subway. The pure numerical data didn't take into account any of the geographical features of the data, so I wanted to explore the usage in a more visual way. This project hopes to show interesting pattterns in the subway ridership both geographically, and over time.
